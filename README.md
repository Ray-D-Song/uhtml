*uhtml* (micro *Âµ* html) is one of the smallest, fastest, memory consumption friendly, yet zero-tools based, library to safely help creating or manipulating DOM content.

### ðŸ“£ uhtml v4 is out

### Exports

  * **[uhtml](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/index.js)** as default `{ Hole, render, html, svg, attr }` with smart auto-keyed nodes - read [keyed or not ?](https://webreflection.github.io/uhtml/#keyed-or-not-) paragraph to know more
  * **[uhtml/keyed](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/keyed.js)** with extras `{ Hole, render, html, svg, htmlFor, svgFor, attr }`, providing keyed utilities - read [keyed or not ?](https://webreflection.github.io/uhtml/#keyed-or-not-) paragraph to know more
  * **[uhtml/node](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/node.js)** with *same default* exports but it's for *one-off* nodes creation only so that no cache or updates are available and it's just an easy way to hook *uhtml* into your existing project for DOM creation (not manipulation!)
  * **[uhtml/init](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/init.js)** which returns a `document => uhtml/keyed` utility that can be bootstrapped with `uhtml/dom`, [LinkeDOM](https://github.com/WebReflection/linkedom), [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) for either *SSR* or *Workers* support
  * **uhtml/ssr** which exports an utility that both SSR or Workers can use to parse and serve documents. This export provides same keyed utilities except the keyed feature is implicitly disabled as that's usually not desirable at all for SSR or rendering use cases, actually just an overhead. This might change in the future but for now I want to benchmark and see how competitive is `uhtml/ssr` out there. The `uhtml/dom` is also embedded in this export because the `Comment` class needs an override to produce a super clean output (at least until hydro story is up and running).
  * **[uhtml/dom](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/dom.js)** which returns a specialized *uhtml* compliant DOM environment that can be passed to the `uhtml/init` export to have 100% same-thing running on both client or Web Worker / Server. This entry exports `{ Document, DOMParser }` where the former can be used to create a new *document* while the latter one can parse well formed HTML or SVG content and return the document out of the box.
  * **[uhtml/reactive](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/reactive.js)** which allows usage of symbols within the optionally *keyed* render function. The only difference with other exports, beside exporting a `reactive` field instead of `render`, so that `const render = reactive(effect)` creates a reactive render per each library, is that the `render(where, () => what)`, with a function as second argument is mandatory when the rendered stuff has signals in it, otherwise these can't side-effect properly.
    * **[uhtml/signal](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/signal.js)** is an already bundled `uhtml/reactive` with `@webreflection/signal` in it, so that its `render` exported function is already reactive. This is the smallest possible bundle as it's ~3.3Kb but it's not nearly as complete, in terms of features, as *preact* signals are.
    * **[uhtml/preactive](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/uhtml/preactive.js)** is an already bundled `uhtml/reactive` with `@preact/signals-core` in it, so that its `render` exported function, among all other *preact* related exports, is already working. This is a *drop-in* replacement with extra *Preact signals* goodness in it so you can start small with *uhtml/signal* and switch any time to this more popular solution.

### uhtml/init example

```js
import init from 'uhtml/init';
import { Document } from 'uhtml/dom';

const document = new Document;

const {
  Hole,
  render,
  html, svg,
  htmlFor, svgFor,
  attr
} = init(document);
```

### uhtml/preactive example

```js
import { render, html, signal, detach } from 'uhtml/preactive';

const count = signal(0);

render(document.body, () => html`
  <button onclick=${() => { count.value++ }}>
    Clicks: ${count.value}
  </button>
`);

// stop reacting to signals in the future
setTimeout(() => {
  detach(document.body);
}, 10000);
```
